# Graph ql learning

## what is graph ql?,

- for frontend development it is a query language for API
- for backend development it is a runtime for specifying how resources are queried efficiently

## why graph ql?, what problem does graph-ql solve?

- solve the problem of over-fetching and under-fetching data by allowing the client to specify the data they want

## Bottle neck in graph ql (not paying attention to the query)!

- if query is handled poorly it can can circular querying and become inefficient.
- resource base caching can be hard to implement.
